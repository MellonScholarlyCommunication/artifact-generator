  Linkages between research outputs are crucial in the scholarly knowledge graph. 
  They include online citations, but also links between versions that differ according 
  to various dimensions and links to resources that were used to arrive at research 
  results. In current scholarly communication systems this information is only made 
  available post factum and is obtained via elaborate batch processing. In this paper 
  we report on work aimed at making linkages available in real-time, in which an 
  alternative, decentralised scholarly communication network is considered that consists 
  of interacting data nodes that host artifacts and service nodes that add value to 
  artifacts. The first result of this work, the "Event Notifications in Value-Adding Networks" 
  specification, details interoperability requirements for the exchange of real-time 
  life-cycle information pertaining to artifacts using Linked Data Notifications. 
  In an experiment, we applied our specification to one particular use-case: distributing 
  Scholix data-literature links to a network of Belgian institutional repositories by a 
  national service node. The results of our experiment confirm the potential of our 
  approach and provide a framework to create a network of interacting nodes implementing 
  the core scholarly functions (registration, certification, awareness and archiving) 
  in a decentralized and decoupled way.
